# Suggestion
Since BDO Plus works as stand alone software and does not inject into game that means you cannot use it in fullscreen mode as game overlay,  i suggest you to use it on second monitor or change your game display settings to **borderless window**
also if you have windows 11 make sure to update it and enable **Optimizations for windowed games**
